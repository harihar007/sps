This game is one of the most played game among all of us.To do coding for the game is quite easy.Let's see to it. In this code there is no need to install anything.We are importing a module called "tkinter" and "random".The tkinter module is to use the GUI interface. In the define section we are giving the rules of a game based on winner and looser.And the next part right from window=tkinter.Tk() is giving the display box with different colours in it.
